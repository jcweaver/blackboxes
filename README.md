## Summary

This repo contains work performed by Joanie Weaver, Sandip Panesar, Jackie Nichols, Rakesh Walisheter for the [Kaggle Facial Keypoint Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/c/facial-keypoints-detection) challenge as our final project for W207. This notebook contains several different neural networks with the XX approach yielding the best result of XX.   


### The Challenge

The objective of this task is to predict keypoint positions on face images. This can be used as a building block in several applications, such as:

* tracking faces in images and video
* analysing facial expressions
* detecting dysmorphic facial signs for medical diagnosis
* biometrics / face recognition

Detecing facial keypoints is a very challenging problem.  Facial features vary greatly from one individual to another, and even for a single individual, there is a large amount of variation due to 3D pose, size, position, viewing angle, and illumination conditions. Computer vision research has come a long way in addressing these difficulties, but there remain many opportunities for improvement.

## Performance Criteria

The Kaggle facial detection challenge asks participants to identify the (x,y) coordinates for up to 15 facial landmarks on a given Test dataset that contains 1783 images. The images are sized 96x96x1 and are in grayscale.  Each facial point must be submitted as their individual (x,y) coordinates for scoring which equates to up to 30 values (2x15) for an image that contains all 15 facial landmarks. 

### Peformance

This solution aheives a best score of **TBD RMSE** using the model, which places X place on the locked leaderboard. 

## Project Approach
To reach the final output of the project and to support the summary findings above, TBD
